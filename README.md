# What is phpJS?
* phpJS is a type of "Template Processor" which will work both as a transpiler (using ECMA Script) for Javascript and PHP intermediate, It might work the same as NodeJS. However it is just a Template Processor Framework, which means it instructs Javascript Code to convert the HTML/CSS into a Wireframe and then into Stylesheets which then allows the Framework to construct several UI/UX using a "Page Load" Algorithm and then loads the remaining HTML/CSS elements into your App..
