# What is phpJS?
* phpJS is a type of "Template Processor" that will work both as a bridge for Javascript and PHP, It might function the same as NodeJS (since I will integrate asynchronous calls into it). However it is just a Template Processor Framework, which means it instructs Javascript Code to convert the HTML/CSS into a Wireframe using a "Page Load" Algorithm then recalls all the remaining HTML/CSS elements into your App Page..
