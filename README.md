### What is phpJS?
* phpJS is a type of "Template Processor" that will work both as a bridge for Javascript and PHP, It might function the same as NodeJS (since I will integrate asynchronous calls into it). However it is just a Template Processor Framework, which means it instructs Javascript Code to convert your HTML/CSS syntax into a Wireframe using a "Page Load" Algorithm then recalls all the remaining HTML/CSS elements into your App Page..

### Sample Function:
* <script>phpJS("#element_id","page_url.html");</script>

### How it works?
* page_url (Recall or Load, Wireframe from Page URL) => template_processor (Javascript) => app_page (Loaded the Finish Product)
